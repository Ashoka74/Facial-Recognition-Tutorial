# Facial-Recognition-Tutorial

This tutorial was run on Python 3.7.4

Used libraries : numpy, cv2, caer


A little Tutorial I followed on the following link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o&t=11893s), I improved the algorithm by iterating haar_cascade's minNeighbor parameter and return the best result 

You just have to define DIR as your training path and People as the name of the folders contained in DIR.

Also, download 'haar_face_detection.xml' and place it in your PATH to enable face_detection.

Hope you enjoy, feel free to contact me if you have questions or issues
